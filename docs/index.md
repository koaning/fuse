# The Sentence Encoder Diaries

My employer [Rasa](https://rasa.com) (we're hiring) gives me education days
each year that I can use to teach myself new skills. In 2020 I used this time to 
challenge myself to make a different kind of educational content. Now, in 2021 I 
decided to use these days to build a sentence encoder from scratch. The goal isn't 
to build something that is very state of the art, but rather to build something that is 
useful while learning lots of things along the way. 

## The project 

The goal is to create a fine-tunable sentence encoder. Hence the name `fusebox`. 
It's a box of tricks related to this encoder. Hopefully, the end product is something
that will help me label a new dataset, but the main goal is to learn interesting
things while working on a hard problem.
