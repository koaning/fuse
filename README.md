Finetune-able Universal Sentence Encoder. Work in Progress. 

> My employer, [Rasa](https://rasa.com/), gives me education days every year to try something new. This year, I've decided to build a sentence encoder. The goal of this project is to create a variant of the [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf) that is lightweight to run but easy to finetune. The main trick though, will involve multi-task learning on different datasets.
